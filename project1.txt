/unit, user,     ! mm-N-MPa
/Prep7           ! start preprocessor

!Define the element types:
ET,1,Plane183    ! 8-node 2D plane element type for matrix
ET,2,Plane183    ! 8-node 2D plane element type for fiber

!Matrix Properties (Epoxy):
MP, EX, 1, 3.5             ! Young's modulus for matrix (3.5 Gpa) (isotropic)
MP, PRXY, 1, 0.35          ! Poisson's ratio for matrix (0.35)(isotropic)

!Fiber Properties (Carbon Fiber):
MP, EX, 2, 22.4       ! Young's modulus in x-direction for fiber (22.4 GPa)
MP, EY, 2, 22.4       ! Young's modulus in y-direction for fiber (22.4 GPa)
MP, EZ, 2, 250.0      ! Young's modulus in z-direction for fiber (250 GPa)
MP, GXY, 2, 8.30      ! Shear modulus in xy-plane (8.30 GPa)
MP, GXZ, 2, 22.1      ! Shear modulus in xz-plane (22.1 GPa)
MP, GYZ, 2, 22.1      ! Shear modulus in yz-plane (22.1 GPa)
MP, PRXY, 2, 0.35     ! Poisson's ratio in xy-plane (0.35)
MP, PRXZ, 2, 0.027    ! Poisson's ratio in xz-plane (0.027)
MP, PRYZ, 2, 0.027    ! Poisson's ratio in yz-plane (0.027)



!Create the model or geometry:
BLC4,0.0,0.0,10.0,10.0   ! Create a rectangular matrix (10 mm x 10 mm)
CYL4,0.0,0.0,7.0         ! Create a circular fiber with radius 7 mm
ASBA,1,2,,,keep          ! Subtract the fiber area from the matrix


!Mesh the model:
ESIZE, 2               ! Element size set to 2 mm
MSHKEY, 2              ! Mapped mesh where possible
TYPE, 1                ! Matrix elements type 1
MAT, 1                 ! Assign material 1 (matrix) to the mesh
AMESH, ALL             ! Mesh all areas
FINISH

!Apply Boundary Conditions and Loads
/SOLUTION
DL, ALL, UX    ! Constrain displacement in X direction along symmetry edge
DL, ALL, UY    ! Constrain displacement in Y direction along symmetry edge
SFL,2,PRES,-10      ! Apply pressure load of -10 MPa on the fiber area
SOLVE               ! Solve the system
FINISH              ! End solution phase
